# Development

## [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

This project uses Discord.py for interactions with discord. You can find more information in the header link above. They
have several examples that can be found [here](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/master/examples). There are
also several blog posts about how to create a bot. For example [this](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/).

## Docker

We dockerize the bot to make it easy to transfer to any system, as well as being easily deployable. If you have any
cheap Kubernetes/ECR cluster available you can toss on a discord bot made with this template very easily.
